# Mitigating Resource-Exhaustion Attacks (DDoS) on GraphQL APIs

This repository contains code examples that demonstrate strategies for protecting GraphQL APIs from resource-exhaustion attacks, which are a common form of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. These attacks can overwhelm a server and cause it to become inaccessible, leading to downtime, lost revenue, and damage to the API service provider's reputation.
